Andrew Ng course on Coursera

This work includes assignments making use of the concepts studied in the course.Some of them are as follows-
1)Recognize hand-written digits using neural network
2)Spam classifier using support vector machine(SVM) 
3)Compression of image using K-means clustering algorithm
4)Low dimension representation of face images using Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
5)Detecting failing servers using anomaly detection algorithm.
